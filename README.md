### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marius Stanca, and I am passionate Software Engineer, mostly on DevOps side, with 8+ years of building things to solve different problems.

Right now I am focusing on breaching the barrier between product development and cloud platforms. That means I apply Software Engineering in DevOps and Site Reliability, and enabling better collaboration between development and operation teams.
